# 🫖 Chai – Workfunding for Creators

**Chai** is a unique **workfunding platform** that empowers creators to showcase their creative work and get funded for it. Think of it as a mini-portfolio meets crowdfunding. Artists, writers, devs — anyone can build a personal creative page and share it with the world 🌍. Supporters can view the page and fund the work directly 💸.
